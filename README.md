# SSI COVID 10 Data insights and analytics

## Getting started with the project

### Installation
We have containerised our project, therefore we may run the project by executing the following docker command:

`docker-compose up`

After the containers have successfully started, our API will be exposed on `localhost` port `5000`

Now, we only need to populate our database, which can be done by visiting `http://localhost:5000/`
